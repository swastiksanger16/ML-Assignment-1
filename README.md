The Medical Cost Personal Dataset from Kaggle contains information on individuals’ medical expenses based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, region, and gender. The goal of the analysis is to predict insurance charges using regression models.
To achieve this, we have implemented Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).
